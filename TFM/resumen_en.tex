\chapter*{Abstract}

The technological market is very fragmented with respect to \gls{iot} solutions. We need the product development based on these systems to be compatible with most market platforms.

In this project, we intend to create a \gls{dsl} where we orthogonalize the design of technological choice. This
way, we can specify the relationships between the different elements that make up
the design in the vocabulary of the business area in question. The
model, is formal and allows defining projections to different technological solutions on a general purpose target language.

Using \gls{mde} in \gls{mdsd} variant, design and developt with the \gls{emf} development environment we can use these definitions and implement them directly
in software through the transformation of \gls{ecore} models, avoiding the lack of coordination between requirements, documentation and implementation within a software project, as automation in the validation and verification of the generated program.
